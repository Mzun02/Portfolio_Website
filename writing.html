<p>This page as I talked to you abour is just a lot of text with some small graphics to break up my stories/author's notes, this just felt more effecient then a ton of Lorem Ipsum. It's going to be a streamline set up of one piece on top of another, author's notes in between and graphics and just small graphics for each piece to break up the text</p>
